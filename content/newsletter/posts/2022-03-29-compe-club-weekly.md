**WHERE:** Apply at the following [link](https://20181219170640_dwkonvne4oo2mopl.applytojob.com/apply/suz8fEab7O/Internship-Application-Venture-For-Canada)

**WHAT:** We are now accepting applications for Summer 2022 internships. Apply to Qualify for Venture for Canada Internship Funding!

Experience Startup culture and get paid for it. Learning more about yourself with a boost from VFC's training will grow your opportunities when you graduate. Venture for Canada provides a job board where you can apply to positions with Partner Employers looking to hire eager student talent.

If you're seeking an internship: we review your resume and your suitability for an internship with a VFC employer. You may receive access to our exclusive job board right away, or we might ask you to make some updates to your resume first. You are not guaranteed a job offer from our board.

If you have a pending job offer: we review your application and invite you to a short webinar to confirm you're eligible to receive our funding, and that you're the right candidate for an internship with a VFC employer. You are not guaranteed acceptance just because you have an offer.
